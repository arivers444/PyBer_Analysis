# PyBer Analysis Report

## Background and Results

### Purpose
  - The purpose of this project was to create visualizations that illustrate key metrics for PyBer ride-sharing data by city type.

### Technical Analysis
  - The ride share data was analyzed to find the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride, and average fare per driver for each city type: rural, suburban, and urban.

### Results
  - The following DataFrame shows that total rides, total drivers, and therefore, total fares in rural city types is less than that of suburban which is less than that of urban city types. It can als be seen that the average fare per ride and average fare per driver take on an inverse relationship to the number of rides and drivers.

  - The following graph shows the total fare by city type for January, February, March, and April of 2019. It can be seen that the most revenue is generated from urban cities followed by suburban cities and rural cities.

### Summary
  - Illustrated above, more fare revenue is generated per ride for rural cities where rides are less frequent but longer rides. Moving to suburban and urban cities increases, respectively, the number of rides, however, the length of each ride also decreases respectively. This decreases the cost per ride. Shown in the second graph, however, most revenue is generated from the shorter, more frequent rides of the urban cities, followed by the suburban cities and rural cities.
